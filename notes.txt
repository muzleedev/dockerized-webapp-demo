Docker setup
Simple dockerized demo webapp

Tech Stack

    Backend: Nodejs Rest API
    Frontend: React SPA
    Database: Redis

DockerHub images:
    Backend: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/muzlee/webapp-backend
    Frontend: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/muzlee/webapp-frontend


Setup:
The frontend sends request to /api -> which is locally proxied to backend
In production the frontend sends request to /api which goes back to frontend nginx which redirects the request to backend
This way the backend is not reachable directly just through the nginx server
